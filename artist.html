                    <p>I am a high school student at Druga Gimnazija Sarajevo. This exhibition, "Chasing Deadlines," is my first photography project using analog cameras, focusing on the daily experiences of students.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>"Chasing Deadlines" is my attempt to capture the frantic, chaotic experience that defines the lives of many high school students. I chose black-and-white film as my medium for this project. This exhibition features nine photographs, each inspired by my personal experiences in high school. These images capture moments like studying late at night, consumed by darkness, or hastily preparing cheat sheets just before a test. But they also aim to depict the abstract feelings: the overwhelming rush of deadlines, the chaos of multitasking, or the mindless scrolling that traps us in cycles of procrastination. I experimented with both documentary style photography and more artistic, interpretive shots to fully explore these emotions and scenes.</p>
                    
                    <p>I didn't want to rely solely on obvious visual depictions of stress, such as dramatic images of overflowing homework or giant to-do lists. Instead, I tried to explore this topic more deeply, portraying not only the causes of stress themselves, like procrastination, but also their consequences, such as cheating. These photographs aim to go beyond the surface of the high school experience, they aim to invite people to talk about the hidden toll that academic demands can take on young minds.</p>
